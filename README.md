Review

We looked all over the place and still didn't see anything that looked like a pizza place.  We finally had to ask, and I still didn't believe it until I turned the corner and saw the pizza ovens.  

The long dark hall, framed on either side with old album covers was a bit nostalgic,  I could see a video game, one of those older arcade types, and a flat screen, but once inside and around the corner, a mall counter and several large pizza's laid before use  to choose our slice, pepperoni with meatball. 

It was reheated and not bad, it actually retained a good crust, not soggy at all.  We must have been there at just the right time because there wasn't a line, and only three other people around.  I had read there could be a long line and wait A definite must try kind of place.

I am picky and I'm also not one who is going to go ooooo & aaaaaah over a lot of things.  That being said, in Phoenix, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an apartment complex.  Andante Apartments has everything pretty much that every other complex has and that being said, I focused on what it didn't have instead to sway decision of living.   I don't smell marijuana in the air when I'm walking my dog at night.  I don't hear people in the parking lot at 4:00 am yelling.  I don't see children running amok or leaving toys outside.  In addition this complex houses a great number of Intel employees and young up-and-coming professionals who are not about partying all night being a nuisance the neighbors.  Do you get it like these people do? They go to work, do their their jobs and come home to a place that they can pridefully say they call home.   Yes I live here,  No I'm not employed by this company but hey, come live with us.   The cost is just right & leaves you with not only some extra money to spend but to save as well.

Review

Sign on to a reasonable deal and then watch your monthly rent increase LIKE CRAZY. They are banking on the fact that you won't make the effort to move your stuff to another facility. Also, I signed up for auto-pay and naturally, the credit cards eventually expire. They are merciless about giving you a 25% late fee and wont budge on reversing the charge. Ridiculous, unethical & unscrupulous.

Roller coaster.... Good!!!!    In fact, amazing.

Location of said roller coaster... Even more fabulous.

Location of hotel... Not so good.  Especially when you've dressed nice with your lady pals and head on out to the strip.  3 hours later and 30 propositions from strange weirdos later, we finally made it to Caesars palace.  

Although I had a great time next time I'd book a place closer to wherever the action is (bellagio, Caesars palace).  The upside is it does have free parking below!!
